ADDENDUM:

I am not a vimscript user, but I do develp on OSX, and the plugin would not work as-is for me.  I made enough tweaks so that I can edit the file in the default changelist automatically when I edit a RO file in a Perforce project.  That's about it.

At some point I will revisit and cleanup, perhaps.  For now I just wanted automatic file checkout instead of having to pull up the Perforce GUI

Perforce is a source control system from http://www.perforce.com

Features:
- menu and keyboard shortcuts to open (checkout), revert, and sync files.
- prompts to open a file for editing when you attempt to change a checked-in file.
- perforce status displayed on the ruler.
- tested on Windows operating systems only.

This plugin provides a relatively few commonly used commands. If you are looking for the ability to carry out many perforce commands from within vim, you may wish to look at  Hari Krishna Dara's plugin (script 240)  at http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=240.
